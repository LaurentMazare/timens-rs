# timens-rs

Simple and efficient timestamp representation. The main objective being
interoperability with OCaml [Core_kernel.Time_ns](https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/v0.13/doc/core_kernel/Core_kernel/Time_ns/index.html).

A significant part of the code has been adapted from the OCaml [Core_kernel](https://github.com/janestreet/core_kernel) implementation.
